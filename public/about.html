        <p>
          Matris Apothecary is brought to you by <strong>Brianna Harrison</strong>, a mother and herbalist at heart who was determined to create skin care products that were as nourishing and natural as they were effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          What began in her own kitchen—experimenting with tallow, plant infusions, and sun-safe ingredients—quickly grew into a trusted line of skincare. Every product we make is rooted in simplicity, whole ingredients, and the wisdom of generations past.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Matris Apothecary, we believe in skincare that honors the body, supports the skin barrier, and taps into nature's original pharmacy. Whether you're applying our tallow balm, sunscreen, or healing salve—you can trust that you're getting something clean, intentional, and made with care.
        </p>
        <p>We're so grateful you're here.</p>
